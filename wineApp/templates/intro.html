      <p class="main_box_p">Putting Nature in the heart of its action to bring the finest, is the ultimate desire of Maison
        Albert Lebrun by unveiling its organic Champagne. This cuvée is the latest creation from
        its prestigious Terroir Collection. This organic Champagne is made exclusively from organic
        viticulture to have a perfect harmony between earth, vineyards and the human. For the
        House, creating an organic Champagne is also part of a global process respectful of the
        environment, with the care for eco-friendly packaging.
        With this organic Champagne, Albert Lebrun is part of the engagement in the terroir and the
        meticulous respect of environment. The House surrounds itself with a pioneer in agrobiology
        in Champagne who has respected with passion the specifications of the organic farming* since
        1971. This new viticulture excludes the harmful products for the environment by respecting
        soil, biodiversity, air and water. The perfect symbiosis of Nature and Human results in a most
        natural version of the wine which will reveal a Champagne with an exceptional purity during
        the tasting.
